Check your nike orders with ease! Use orders_to_check.csv to fill out order email/ order number for the orders you want to run a check on or create your own csv file that is in
the same format. If you use your own csv file, make sure to update the input file name in settings.json. Successfully scraped orders will be entered into the output file set in settings.json. By default this is order_results.csv! Again, if you create your own csv file then it must be in the same format as the order_results.csv file.

Files must be in the same directory. If you create a folder within the scripts' directory, enter its relative path. Ex : If I create a data folder in the script directory and add
my input file in it, I would put "./data/orders_to_check.csv"

Set use_proxies value in settings.json to true if you'd like it to use the proxies in your proxies.txt file. The script currently only supports bnb import as I do not have nike bots to test. Script has been tested and working for Nike US/ SG but it should work globally!
